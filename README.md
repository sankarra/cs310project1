Using the build.xml file, ant init creates the 3 folders, ant clean removes them,
ant compile compiles all my .java files and places it in the bin directory. Please make sure to run ant init before ant compile so that the correct .class files will be placed in the bin folder. ant dist creates the .jar file, ant doc generates javadoc comments and places that in the doc folder, and finally ant test runs all the JUnit tests. Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to point to multiple JUnit tests files, so I placed all my tests under junitTest.java. Hopefully this won't cause too many problems, and I apologize for not knowing how to do that.
